-> in the database, topic has course in the primary key. Is this what we want to do? Will it be difficult to insert questions for the instructor?
-> should we serialize section because it is referenced way too many times and recursively as well
--> We should add weightage to the quiz.





-- When inserting in checked ensure that the section of the quiz and ta match




















INSTRUCTOR:

xx check session and role in every servlet
xx create new course
xx with every new section created, we need to find the threadid and then add to teaches
-- add drop down for semesters
-- in drop down for course, display the name as well
-- course page on clicking on course
