-> in the database, topic has course in the primary key. Is this what we want to do? Will it be difficult to insert questions for the instructor?
-> should we serialize section because it is referenced way too many times and recursively as well
--> We should add weightage to the quiz.





-- When inserting in "checked" ensure that the section of the quiz and ta match

-- There is no pop-up box on failure of creation of a section right now

-- On opening InstructorHome without logging in, there is a server error (check for all other files as well)
















INSTRUCTOR:

xx check session and role in every servlet
xx create new course
xx with every new section created, we need to find the threadid and then add to teaches
-- add drop down for semesters
-- in drop down for course, display the name as well
xx course page on clicking on course
xx add question
-- check login in AllSection
